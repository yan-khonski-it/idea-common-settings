# Common IDE settings

We use IntelliJ IDEA as IDE. We use common styles 
[Google Java styles](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml).

However, we modified the window width = 160 characters, because modern monitors are wider 16:9.

Import these settings when onboarding.
